# Text-To-Speech
This program uses tkinter, google tts, playsound and pyttsx3.
Pytts3 is used to integrate the American accent while also removing the need to save the audio in the system temporarily while program isn't terminated. 
Functions have been used to provide the text inputs as arguments to the pyttsx3 function and play the audio.
This program is a version which can play as many times without clicking the reset button. 
If pyttsx3 isn't used, audio(mp3) has to be saved temporarily, so we would get an error if we play another audio without clicking the reset button.

The version without pyttsx3 (having Indian Accent Voice Model) is also attached with the name "tts1"
